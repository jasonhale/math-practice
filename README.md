> A simple page to generate simple practice math problems.

This page was designed and built for my kids to practice and master simple math problems through repetition while getting used to an application interface. Worked great for my oldest child who was going through similar work at school on printed sheets in the same layout of about 50 problems. It began as a way to generate random problems to print out, but our printer was out of service. So, it quickly became an interactive web page.

See it in action [here](https://jasonhale.github.io/math-practice/).
